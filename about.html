        <p>Hey All! My name is Nathan Davis and I am a Senior at <span><strong>Michigan State University</strong></span> in the college of Communication Arts and Sciences pursuing a Bachelor of Arts Degree in <em>Media and Information</em> with a concentration in <em>Film and Media Production</em>.</p>
        <p>I was raised in <strong>East Lansing</strong> and have wanted to be a Spartan since I was a little kid. My biggest passion is video games, more specifically following and participating in the world of Esports.</p> 
        <p>Over my tenure here at MSU, I have played on two of our Esports teams, <span>MSU Spartans White</span> and <span>MSU Invictus White.</span> The respective games for each team were Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Seige.

        </p>
