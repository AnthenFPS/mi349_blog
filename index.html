            EDEN, otherwise known as Jonathon Ng, is an electronic music producer and artist. He is my favorite musician of all time (so far) and I have been listening to his music since early 2011.<br> 
            He went from releasing only free music under the alias, <em>The Eden Project</em>, and then rebranding to his current name in 2015. His debut album, <em>Vertigo</em>, was released on  January 18, 2018 and featured 13 tracks.<br> My favorite of these songs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FFdYZ1ZsbA">forever//over</a>. His second studio album, <em>No Future</em> was released on February 14, 2020 and featured 17 tracks. My favorite track from this album is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asuA2-pbch0">isohel</a>.<br>
            I would consider EDEN's music to be a mix of indie-rock and alternative with elements of electronic music mixed in throughout. Many people flock to his music because his storytelling is very compelling<br> and his songs make you want to sing along. Many song themes include heartbreak, relationship struggles, life struggles, etc. which many people can relate to.<br>
            Recently with the overwhelming popularity of the social media app "<em>Tik-Tok</em>" one of EDEN's songs "<em>Sex (Catching Feelings)</em>" was featured on the app and rose drastically in total plays overnight.<br> This recent increase made the song a Certified Gold Record which is only EDEN's second ever.

            <h3>Among Us</h3>

            <p>
            If you were anywhere near the internet recently, you have probably heard or seen gameplay of a game called Among Us. Among Us took the internet by storm seemingly overnight but not many people know the beginning of this story.<br> Among Us was released on June 15, 2018 as a free game first on mobile only and then was moved to PC through steam later. Among Us was developed by one person who exists under the alias of InnerSloth.<br> This game is similar to the party game, Mafia, in which there are a group of players (usually between 6 and 10)that are split into two groups. One small team that is focused on eliminating the other players and the rest of the players are focusing on figuring out who the killer is.<br> The killer is known as the "<em>Imposter(s)</em>" and the other players are labeled as "<em>Crewmates</em>" For the first two years of this game's life it had an average of only 3 players. In late 2019 it gained a little bit of traction and had the player base increase to about 100 average players.<br> This year that number skyrocketed from 100 to over 200 thousand average players per month but how? Popular streamers from a website called Twitch.Tv found out about this game and started livestreaming it to audiences of over 50 thousand viewers.<br>
            This game has even started to have real money tournaments around it featuring popular streamers and celebrities such as SouljaBoy, PewDiePie, and XQC. I would highly recommend playing this game as it is very addicting to play and to watch.
